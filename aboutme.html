        <p>
            Black Panther is a fictional character and superhero appearing in American comic books published by
            Marvel Comics. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, and he is depicted as the king and 
            protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced 
            abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the 
            heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous 
            physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and 
            advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.<br/>I am Ambidextrous. This is my only superpower.
