        <h3>My favorite place is Switzerland</h3>
        <p>Switzerland is a country of <b>Chocolates</b>, <b>watches</b> and <b>banks</b>.
            It is a mountainous Central European country, home to numerous lakes, villages and the high peaks of the Alps.
            It has about 7000 lakes and 208 Mountains. The main reason of why I like Switzerland is that
            they make high-quality chocolates.</p>
